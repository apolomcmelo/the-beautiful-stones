Create a 2D top-down pixel art TILESET for a game.

Technical constraints:
- Tile size: 32x32 pixels
- Style: retro pixel art (Zelda A Link to the Past)
- View: top-down
- Output: PNG, transparent background
- Organized tileset atlas, grid aligned
- Limited color palette (2–3 main colors + 1 accent)
- No text, no letters, no numbers, no UI
- No realism, no gradients, no 3D
- Everything must look hand-crafted in pixel art

Environment concept:
Epic dwarf underground halls inspired by Khazad-dûm (Mines of Moria).
Monumental architecture carved directly into dark stone.
Massive pillars, high arched ceilings, heavy stone walls.
Everything feels ancient, solemn, and eternal.

Visual details:
- Dark blue-gray and graphite stone
- Ancient dwarf runes carved into stone (static, worn, no glow)
- Natural mithril veins inside walls and floors, subtle blue-silver reflection
- Low indirect lighting from torches and stone fissures

Bureaucracy elements integrated into epic architecture:
- Stone desks carved from rock
- Stone archives and shelves
- Ancient parchment stacks on stone surfaces
- Heavy rune-carved stone or metal stamps
- Stalactites dripping pinkish bureaucratic ink onto the floor

Color palette:
- Dark stone (blue-black, graphite)
- Cold gray
- Subtle mithril blue accent
- Muted pink ink accent
