- Style: retro pixel art (Zelda A Link to the Past)
- View: top-down
- Output: PNG, transparent background
- Organized tileset atlas, grid aligned
- Limited color palette (2–3 main colors + 1 accent)
- No text, no letters, no numbers, no UI
- No realism, no gradients, no 3D
- Everything must look hand-crafted in pixel art

Environment concept:
Supreme dwarf administrative chamber.
A dark Khazad-dûm stone hall mixed with the oppressive heat and excess of Spanish bureaucracy.
Feels underground, heavy, dark — but filled with warm, suffocating light.

- Warm golden and yellow light flooding the room from above
- Stone floor polished with golden tones
- Air feels hot, dry, and dense

Central elements:
- Colossal stone-and-metal desk like an altar
- Endless stacks of parchment
- Giant stamps as symbols of authority
- Red tape represented as heavy red cloth or opaque magical barriers

Color palette:
- Dark stone
- Warm gold
- Burnt yellow
- Deep red
